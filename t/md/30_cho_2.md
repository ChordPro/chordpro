**Chorus**

	      D          G    D  
	Swing low, sweet chariot,  
	                       A7  
	Comin’ for to carry me home.  
	      D7         G    D  
	Swing low, sweet chariot,  
	              A7       D  
	Comin’ for to carry me home.

	  D                       G          D  
	I looked over Jordan, and what did I see,  
	                             A7  
	     “Comin’ for to carry me home.”  
	  D7             G            D  
	A band of angels comin’ after me,  
	                   A7       D         G    D    G  
	     Comin’ for to carry me home.               --

> Chorus  

If you get there before I do,  
     Comin’ for to carry me home.  
Just tell my friends that I’m a comin’ too.  
     Comin’ for to carry me home.  

> Chorus  

I’m sometimes up and sometimes down,  
     Comin’ for to carry me home.  
But still my soul feels heavenly bound.  
     Comin’ for to carry me home.  

> Chorus  
> *And a final chorus*
