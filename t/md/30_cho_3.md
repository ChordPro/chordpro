# Swing Low Sweet Chariot
## Traditional

**Chorus**

Swing low, sweet chariot,  
Comin’ for to carry me home.  
Swing low, sweet chariot,  
Comin’ for to carry me home.  

---------------  

I looked over Jordan, and what did I see,  
     “Comin’ for to carry me home.”  
A band of angels comin’ after me,  
     Comin’ for to carry me home.  

---------------  

> Chorus  

If you get there before I do,  
     Comin’ for to carry me home.  
Just tell my friends that I’m a comin’ too.  
     Comin’ for to carry me home.  

> Chorus  

I’m sometimes up and sometimes down,  
     Comin’ for to carry me home.  
But still my soul feels heavenly bound.  
     Comin’ for to carry me home.  

> Chorus  
> *And a final chorus*
---------------
