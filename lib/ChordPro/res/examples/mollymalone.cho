# First verse of the song, with chords.

She [G]was a fish [Em]monger
but [Am]sure, 'twas no [D7]wonder
For [G]so were her [Em]father and [A7]mother be[D7]fore
They [G]both wheeled their [Em]barrows
through [Am]streets broad and [D7]narrow
Crying [G]“Cockles and Mus[Em]sels, a[A7]live a[D7]live-[G]o”

She died of the fever,
and nothing could save her
And that was the end of sweet Molly Malone
But her ghost wheels a barrow
through streets broad and narrow
Crying “Cockles and Mussels, alive alive-o”
