# Special Symbols for ChordPro

The tool `uc.py` creates a font `ChordProSymbols.ttf` out of
`Cadman.ttf` and `NotoSansSymbols-Regular.ttf`.

Most important are the black circles with digits 0 .. 9 and letters A
.. Z. These are used for fingering in string diagrams.
For non-fingered strings, the glyph at `/` is used. This is just a
copy of the circled 1 but will be drawn on a foreground spot, making
it a fully filled circle.
