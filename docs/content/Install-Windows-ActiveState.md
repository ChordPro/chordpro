# ActiveState Perl on Microsoft Windows

![]({{< asset "images/maintenance.png" >}})

**ActiveState repository is currently having problems distributing
recent Perl modules. You may wish to try [Strawberry Perl]({{< relref "Install-Windows-Strawberry" >}}) instead.**

Download ActiveState Perl, Community Edition, from <https://www.activestate.com/activeperl/downloads>.
Install according to the directions on the site.

One of the tools that will be installed is the ActiveState Perl Package Manager, `ppm`. When you start this tool you can select additional packages to be installed on your system. Select the package `App::Music::ChordPro::Wx` and install it.

The ChordPro program `wxchordpro` will be installed by default in `C:\ActiveState\Perl\bin`. It can be executed using a command prompt. Alternatively, you can add a shortcut icon to the desktop.

You may now proceed to [Getting Started]({{< relref "ChordPro-Getting-Started" >}}).
