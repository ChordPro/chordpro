# Chords over Lyrics

Before ChordPro it was common to write lead sheets with chords on
separate lines preceding the lyrics. This is often referred to as
**crd** format. For example

          D          G    D
    Swing low, sweet chariot,
                           A7
    Comin’ for to carry me home.

ChordPro tries to detect whether the input files are in this legacy
format and if so, internally converts the data to ChordPro (**cho**
format) before processing.

    Swing [D]low, sweet [G]chari[D]ot,
    Comin’ for to carry me [A7]home.
    
The *Graphical Application* can convert your `cut/pasted` songs from sites like [Ultimate Guitar](https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com) into **ChordPro** format to tweak it to your needs.
