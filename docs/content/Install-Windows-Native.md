# Binary installation on Microsoft Windows

_This information may be sub-optimal and/or incomplete. Please help improving it._

Download ChordPro-GUI-installer-xxxx-msw-x64.exe from [SourceForge](https://sourceforge.net/projects/chordii/files/chordii/5.0/) and execute it. This will install the GUI version of ChordPro.

Alternatively, you can download ChordPro-CLI-xxxx-msw-x64.zip, which contains the command line version of ChordPro. Unpacking the zip will produce the standalone `chordpro.exe` program.

You may now proceed to [Getting Started]({{< relref "ChordPro-Getting-Started" >}}).
