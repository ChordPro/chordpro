# Installation on Microsoft Windows

![](images/maintenance.png)

## Binaries

If you're not sure which option to take, use the
[[Native install kit|Install Windows Native]] (reported to run on
64-bit Windows 7, 8 and 10) and download the GUI installer. A CLI version is also available there. 

## Using Perl

Microsoft Windows systems are not standard equipped with the Perl application environment. You need to download and install Perl yourself.

Currently, there are some easy options (and several harder ones that will not be discussed here).

* [[Strawberry Perl|Install Windows Strawberry]]  
This is also an open source Perl distribution, but it needs some manual work to get everything going.
* [[Citrus Perl|Install Windows Citrus]]  
This is an open source Perl distribution which includes many tools.
Unfortunately, its future is uncertain.
* [[ActiveState Perl|Install Windows ActiveState]]  
This is a commercial Perl implementation but it provides a Community Edition that is free to use for individuals.
