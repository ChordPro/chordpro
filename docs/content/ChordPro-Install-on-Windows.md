# Installation on Microsoft Windows

## Binaries

Please use the [easy installer]({{< relref "Install-Windows-Native" >}}),
reported to run on 64-bit Windows 7, 8, 10 and 11.

## Using Perl

Microsoft Windows systems are not standard equipped with the Perl
application environment. You need to download and install Perl
yourself.

* [Strawberry Perl]({{< relref "Install-Windows-Strawberry" >}})  
This is also an open source Perl distribution, but it needs some
manual work to get everything going.

_Citrus Perl_ and _ActiveState Perl_ are no longer supported.
