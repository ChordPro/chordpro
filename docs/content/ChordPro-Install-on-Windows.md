Microsoft Windows systems are not standard equipped with the Perl application environment. You need to download and install Perl yourself.

Currently, there are some easy options (and several harder ones that will not be discussed here).

* [[Native install kit|Install Windows Native]]  
A native install kit is available for modern 64-bit Windows. It is reported to run on Windows 7, 8 and 10.
* [[Citrus Perl|Install Windows Citrus]]  
This is an open source Perl distribution which includes many tools.
* [[ActiveState Perl|Install Windows ActiveState]]  
This is a commercial Perl implementation but it provides a Community Edition that is free to use for individuals.
* [[Strawberry Perl|Install Windows Strawberry]]  
This is also an open source Perl distribution, but it needs more manual work to get everything going.
