Microsoft Windows systems are not standard equipped with the Perl application environment. You need to download and install Perl yourself.

Currently, there are three easy options (and several harder ones that will not be discussed here).

* [[ActiveState Perl|Install Windows ActiveState]]  
This is a commercial Perl implementation but it provides a Community Edition that is free to use for individuals.
* [[Citrus Perl|Install Windows Citrus]]  
This is an open source Perl distribution which includes many tools.
* [[Strawberry Perl|Install Windows Strawberry]]  
This is also an open source Perl distribution, but it needs more manual work to get everything going.
