## grid

Abbreviation: `g`.

Enables printing of the list of chord diagrams at the end of the current song.

For persistent use, this can also be set in the [[configuration files|ChordPro Configuration]]. However, it is already set by default.

The name `grid` is an unfortunate legacy from the original chord program and must not be confused with the [[chord grids|Directives env_grid]] facility.
