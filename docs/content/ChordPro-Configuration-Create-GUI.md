# Create a new configuration using the GUI

From the `Edit` menu choose `Settingsâ€¦` and select the `Presets` tab.  

*On macOS, the Settings are in the `ChordPro` menu.*

Here you will find the option for a new *Custom Configuration File*.


![]({{< asset "images/chordpro-gui-settings-custom configuration.png" >}})


To create a *new configuration file*, filled with *the default configuration*; just click '**New**'.

A file-dialog will give you the opportunity the give your new configuration a name, save it and select it. Alter it to your [needs]({{< relref "ChordPro-Configuration-Overview" >}}).

### Important

The configuration file contains most of the ChordPro configuration
items, **all commented out**. It is easy to get started with configuring
ChordPro by enabling and modifying just a few items at a time.
