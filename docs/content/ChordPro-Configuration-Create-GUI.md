# Create a configuration using the GUI

_Note that the appearance of dialogs and file names may differ between systems._

From the `Edit` menu choose `Settingss…`.  
*(On macOS, the Settings are in the `ChordPro` menu)*

![]({{< asset "images/prf_cr_cfg_1.png" >}})

Click the checkbox `Custom config` and click the `…` button to open a file dialog.  

![]({{< asset "images/prf_cr_cfg_2.png" >}})

Select a folder and enter the name of a new file, for example `myconfig.json`.  
Click `Open`.

![]({{< asset "images/prf_cr_cfg_4.png" >}})

The new configuration file will be created and filled with default
configuration values.

Note: Config files accumulate, and ChordPro always starts with the
built-in default config. It is **strongly advised** to strip all default
values from the generated config and only leave the modified settings in.
