# Getting started with ChordPro

For a good understanding it is important to know that **ChordPro, the application** is
basically a file transformation program. It reads a file containing
lyrics and chords according to the *ChordPro File Standard* and
produces a neatly formatted PDF document that you can view and print.

## The graphical application

An easy to use application to learn how to use the *ChordPro File Standard* and create beautiful PDF's. However, not just *that*. It can also create great [songbooks]({{< relref "ChordPro-GUI-Songbook" >}}) from your collection of *ChordPro files*.

## The Command Line utility

If you want to tweak your songs to your **exact** needs you have to get your hands dirty and dive into the [command line]({{< relref "ChordPro-Getting-Started-CLI" >}}) for *real* power.

## Chords over Lyrics

Before ChordPro it was common to write lead sheets with chords on
separate lines preceding the lyrics. This is often referred to as
**crd** format. ChordPro can [convert this style]({{< relref "Chords-over-Lyrics" >}}) into its native format.
