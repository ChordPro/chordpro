The way the output is formatted and some behavioural aspects of the reference implementation are configurable via configuration files. These are [JSON](http://www.json.org/) files that can be created and modified using any convenient text editor. There are also several JSON editors available, often in the form of web services. For schema-based editors, the schema can be downloaded from the [ChordPro site](http://www.chordpro.org/chordpro/config50.schema).
