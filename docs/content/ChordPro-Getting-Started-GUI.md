# Getting started with the GUI

We hope you donâ€™t have to read this chapter too often because we made a lot effort to make it *intuitive* for you. It gives you a good start to see the power of the `ChordPro` format with a lot of options to tweak it to your needs.

While **ChordPro, the application** is a great utility to work with **ChordPro, the file standard**; its biggest strength is that it can create beautiful [songbooks]({{< relref "ChordPro-GUI-Songbook" >}}) from your collection of *ChordPro* files.

Have some songs already? Click `Create a Songbook` and navigate to the folder with the songs!

## Basic Usage

When you open *ChordPro* you have several options to get started.

- Create a new song
- Open an existing song
- Create a [songbook]({{< relref "ChordPro-GUI-Songbook" >}}) from a folder with *ChordPro* files
- Open recent files

### Buttons at your service

If you are making a [Songbook]({{< relref "ChordPro-GUI-Songbook" >}}), creating a new song or editing an existing song; you always have three *important* buttons at your service:

- The **Settings button** will open the `settings dialog` where you you can change the presets to be used for the preview.
- The **Preview button**, well, shows a `preview` of your [Songbook]({{< relref "ChordPro-GUI-Songbook" >}}) or your *ChordPro* file.
- The **Message button** will open the `message log` with the result of *ChordPro* creating the preview PDF. It might give you warnings when there are issues found.

## Settings

*ChordPro* has many settings available. Not just to adjust the look of your PDF. You can change the look of the application but also enable powerful utilities like transposing and transcode your song.

However, these settings are just *start*. If you **really** want to tweak your songs to your needs you have to get your hands dirty and create your own [configuration]({{< relref "chordpro-configuration-create-gui" >}}) or even dive into the [command line](#the-command-line-usage) for *real* power.

Read the [Settings]({{< relref "ChordPro-GUI-Settings" >}}) page for a complete overview.
