# Getting started with the GUI

We hope you don’t have to read this chapter too often because we made
a lot effort to make it *intuitive* for you. It gives you a good start
to see the power of the `ChordPro` format with a lot of options to
tweak it to your needs.

While **ChordPro, the application** is a great utility to work with **ChordPro, the file standard**; its biggest strength is that it can create beautiful [songbooks]({{< relref "ChordPro-GUI-Songbook" >}}) from your collection of *ChordPro* files.

## Basic Usage

When you open the *ChordPro* GUI you have several options to get started.

Are you new to *ChordPro* and ChordPro song files? Choose 
[`Open an example song`]({{< relref "ChordPro-GUI-Songbook" >}}).

Do you have some songs already? Choose [`Create a songbook`]({{< relref "ChordPro-GUI-Songbook" >}}) and navigate
to the folder with the songs.

And of course you can open existing ChordPro song files, and create
new ones.

On the top of the page you can choose between `Create` and `Recent`.
When you click on `Recent` you'll be presented with a list of song
files that you recently used.

### Buttons at your service

If you are making a [Songbook]({{< relref "ChordPro-GUI-Songbook"
>}}), creating a new song or editing an existing song; you always have
three *important* buttons at your service:

![Buttons]({{< asset "images/chordpro-gui-buttons.png" >}})

- The **Settings button** will open the 
[`settings dialog`]({{< relref "chordpro-gui-settings" >}}), where you
you can change the GUI preferences.
- The **Preview button**, will show a `preview` of your [Songbook]({{<
  relref "ChordPro-GUI-Songbook" >}}) or your *ChordPro* song file.
- The **Message button** will open the `message log` with the result
  of *ChordPro* creating the preview PDF. It might give you warnings
  when there are issues found.
  
These services are also reachable via the application menu:

`Edit` > `Settings…` or Ctrl-R (on macOS, the Settings are in the ChordPro
menu and the hotkey is Command-R).

`Tasks` > `Default Preview` or Ctrl-P (macOS: Command-P).

`View` > `Show Messages`

## Settings

*ChordPro* has many settings available. Not just to adjust the look of your PDF. You can change the look of the application but also enable powerful utilities like transposing and transcode your song.

However, these settings are just *start*. If you **really** want to tweak your songs to your needs you have to get your hands dirty and create your own [configuration]({{< relref "chordpro-configuration-create-gui" >}}) or even dive into the [command line](#the-command-line-usage) for *real* power.

Read the [Settings]({{< relref "ChordPro-GUI-Settings" >}}) page for a complete overview.
