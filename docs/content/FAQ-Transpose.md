# D♯ transposes to D♭ but I want C♯

Chords can be transposed by a number of semitones
in the range -12 to +12. 
If transposing results in accidentals, a **positive** value will use
**sharps**, while a **negative** value will use **flats**.

See also [transpose directive]({{< relref "Directives-transpose" >}}).
