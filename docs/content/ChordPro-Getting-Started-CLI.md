# Getting started with the CLI

![ChordPro CLI]({{< asset "images/chordpro-cli-main.png" >}})

If you are familiar with working on the *command line*, the basic command to use is:

```
chordpro mysong.cho
```

This will process `mysong.cho` and produce the PDF document `mysong.pdf`.

`chordpro --help` will give you a list of options that you can pass to the `chordpro` command.

More information can be found in the [Using the ChordPro CLI]({{< relref
"Using-ChordPro" >}}) section.
