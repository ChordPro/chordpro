# Create a Songbook

While all those *individual* files are nice, its even *nicer* when you can combine them into one beautiful PDF. **ChordPro** can do that for you with just a few clicks of the mouse.

- Start a new Songbook from the main screen and it will ask you for a folder with your songs.
- Give your songbook a title and subtitle and *ChordPro* will create a nice cover for you.
- You want to have your own cover? No problem, just select a PDF and it will be used as cover-page instead.
- You can change the order of the songs in the 'file list'.
- Same as for your individual songs; you can change the appearance of the songbook in the [settings]({{< relref "chordpro-gui-settings/#presets" >}}).

## Editing songs for the songbook

If you crated your `preview` but found some songs that are not to your liking; just *double-click* on the song in the *file list* and this will bring you the the editor where you can change the song.

The *standard* 'Settings, preview and 'message' buttons will have an additional **Songbook** button to go back to your songbook again.
