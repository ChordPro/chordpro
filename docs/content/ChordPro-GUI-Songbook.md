# Create a Songbook

While all those *individual* files are nice, its even *nicer* when you
can combine them into one beautiful PDF. **ChordPro** can do that for
you with just a few clicks of the mouse.

Start a new Songbook from the main screen and it will ask you for a
folder with your songs.

Same as for individual songs you can change the appearance of the
songbook in the [settings]({{< relref "chordpro-gui-settings/#presets"
>}}).

You can change the order of the songs in the file list.

Give your songbook a title and subtitle and *ChordPro* will create a
nice cover for you.

You want to have your own cover? No problem, just deselect `Add a
standard cover page` and select a PDF document using the Cover browse
button, and it will be used as cover page instead.

## Editing songs for the songbook

If you created your `preview` but found some songs that are not to
your liking; just *double-click* on the song in the *file list* and
this will bring you the the editor where you can change the song.

The *standard* 'Settings, preview and 'message' buttons will have an
additional **Songbook** button to go back to your songbook again.
