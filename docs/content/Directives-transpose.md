# Directives transpose

`{transpose:` _value_ `}`

This directive indicates that the remainder of the song should be
transposed the number of semitones according to the given _value_,
which is a number in the range -12 to +12. When used at the beginning of
a song, the whole song will be transposed. When used somewhere in the
song it can be used to achieve modulation.

If transposing results in accidentals, a positive value will use
sharps, while a negative value will use flats.

For example:

    [C]A song [D] line with [E]chords   [F]
    {transpose: 2}
    [C]A song [D] line with [E]chords   [F]

This will print:

    C      D         E       F 
    A song line with chords
    D      E         F#      G
    A song line with chords

As can be seen above, transposing `E` with the (positive) value 2
results in `F#`.
Transposing with the (negative) value -10 will result in the
enharmonic equivalent chord `Gâ™­`:

    [C]A song [D] line with [E]chords   [F]
    {transpose: -10}
    [C]A song [D] line with [E]chords   [F]

This will print:

    C      D         E       F 
    A song line with chords
    D      E         Gb      G
    A song line with chords

A `{transpose}` directive without a value will cancel the current transposition, possibly restoring a preceding transposition.

## `transpose` and the `key` metadata

The transpose directive is effective from where it appears in the ChordPro file. It will not affect a `key` directive that precedes it.

If a song has a key, a metadata item `key_actual` is automatically added and contains the actual key including transpositions. If a transposition is in effect, there is also an item `key_from` that contains the actual key _before_ the transposition.
