# ChordPro needs your help!

ChordPro needs your help to get better.

## Users

Just use ChordPro for your lead sheets and scores. [Join the
community]({{< relref "Support#user-forum" >}})
and report your experiences. 

Do not underestimate what other users can learn from you.

And spread the word, involve your fellow musicians. 

## Testers

If you can run the [development version]({{< relref "ChordPro-run-from-Git" >}})
you can become a valuable
tester. You don't even have to perform 'real' tests, just use the
development version for some of your work and report your experiences. 

## Documenters

There is a lot of documentation, but is it all up to date and well
organised? 

## Packagers

Easy installable packages for the miscellaneous platforms that
ChordPro can be run on are crucial to most users, who are usually more
fluid in music than in software development.

### Linux

It would be nice to have packages for

- Debian systems
- Ubuntu systems
- Linux variants like Aur and Mint

Currently we only have an official package in the Fedora repository.

We also have a ChordPro [AppImage](https://www.appimge.org) but it
needs work to suit more platforms.

Some users ask for [flatpak](https://flatpak.org/) or
[docker](https://www.docker.com/). Can you help?

### Microsoft Windows

Currently we provide an installer package for 64-bit Windows 10.

The installer may need improving, e.g. for Windows 11.

Is a 32-bit version needed?

### macOS

Currently we provide an installer package (dmg) for macOS 10.15 and higher. There are separate versions for the *Intel* and *Apple Silicon* architecture.

While working fine; the applications are not *notarised* by a developer with an *Apple Developer certificate*. This prevents a simple ‘drag and drop’ of the application because of the macOS security policy.

If you are a developer with an certificate; it would be great if you can help us delivering a better experience!

## Donations

ChordPro is free software and it is a pleasure developing it but
domains, webservers, internet traffic and storage costs real money.
You can help by making [a small donation]({{< relref
"Support#support-for-us" >}}) to the ChordPro project.
