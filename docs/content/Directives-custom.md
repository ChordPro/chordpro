# Custom directives

ChordPro processing tools may add custom directives for special
purposes.

All directives that start with `x_` (x underscore) are considered
custom extensions. The ChordPro file format specification will never
define directives that start with `x_`, and processing tools are
encouraged to (silently) ignore unknown custom directives.
