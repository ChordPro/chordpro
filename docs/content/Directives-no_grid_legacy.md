## no_grid

Abbreviation: `ng`.

Suppresses printing of the list of chord grids at the end of the current song.

For persistent use, this can also be set in the [[configuration files|ChordPro Configuration]].

The name `grid` is an unfortunate legacy from the original chord program and must not be confused with the [[chord grids|Directives env_grid]] facility.
