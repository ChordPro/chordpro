## comment, comment_italic and comment_box

These directives each introduce a _comment_ line, a piece of text that will be included in the printed output but is not part of the lyrics and chords. The names of these directives originate from the original `chord` program, the difference between these directives is the appearance of the comment text.

Comments can be used to place additional playing instructions in the song.
