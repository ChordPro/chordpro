  Songsheet Generator is an application which prints songsheets
  and songbooks for home, small group, or large group 
  use. The program runs on Microsoft Windows (native .exe),
  Mac OS X (Java-based native .app), and any platform that
  supports Java 1.5 (.jar file). Song files must be provided in
  the ChordPro format, a common text format found on the internet
  (ChordPro files are easy to make yourself, if you can't find the
  song you're looking for). Also Songsheet Generator will import
  some basic tab (CRD) files, so you can print a songsheet or
  songbook from any songs you might already have in that
  format.
