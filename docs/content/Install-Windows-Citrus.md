Download Citrus Perl from <https://sourceforge.net/projects/citrusperl/files>.
Install according to the directions on the site.

One of the desktop icons that will be installed is `citrusterm`. With this tool you can start a command prompt window that is preconfigured for Citrus Perl. In this command prompt window type:

`cpan install App::Music::ChordPro::Wx`

This will download and install the ChordPro program `wxchordpro`. It can be executed from the citrusterm command prompt. Alternatively, you can add a shortcut icon to the desktop.

You may now proceed to [[Getting Started|ChordPro Getting Started]].
