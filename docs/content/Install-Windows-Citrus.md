Download Citrus Perl from <http://www.citrusperl.com/p/download.html>.
Install according to the directions on the site.

An important tool is `citrusterm` which you can find in the CitrusPerl `bin` folder. With this tool you can start a command prompt window that is preconfigured for Citrus Perl. It may be convenient to create a desktop shortcut for this.

Start `citrusterm` and in the command prompt window type:

`cpan install App::Music::ChordPro::Wx`

This will download and install the ChordPro program `wxchordpro`. It can be executed from the citrusterm command prompt. Alternatively, you can add a shortcut icon to the desktop.

You may now proceed to [[Getting Started|ChordPro Getting Started]].
