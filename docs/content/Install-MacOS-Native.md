# Easy installation on macOS

We provide packages (dmg) for macOS 10.15 and higher.

There are separate versions for the *Intel* and *Apple Silicon* architecture.

Download ChordPro-xxxx.dmg from
[GitHub](https://github.com/ChordPro/chordpro/releases/latest) and
open it.

Once the `.dmg` is open, you will see a **READ ME FIRST** document.

**Please read it; due to macOS safety restrictions you cannot just run the program:**

*Your download contains an almost ready to go **ChordPro**; except that the application is only ad-hoc signed by us and not by an approved Apple Developer with a valid certificate. So, the security system on your Mac will give an error when you double-click the application.*

## The 'command line' program

The **ChordPro** application is not just the *graphical interface*,

it also contains the <code>Terminal</code> application; it is part of the package.

Its usage is explained in the **READ ME FIRST** document that is part of the package.

## Help us

Are you a macOS developer with an Developer Account? Please help us to provide a signed package to improve the user experience.

You may now proceed to [Getting Started]({{< relref "ChordPro-Getting-Started" >}}).

It is probably a good idea to read the section [Personal and System
configuration files]({{<
relref "chordpro-install-on-macos#personal-configuration" >}}).
