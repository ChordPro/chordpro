# Installing ChordPro

The ChordPro reference implementation is both a *graphical application*, as well a powerful *command line* program written in the Perl programming environment.

The code is completely *Open Source* and its sources are available on [GitHub](https://github.com/ChordPro/chordpro) and the Comprehensive Perl Archive Network, [CPAN](http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?chordpro).

## Easy installation

### Windows and macOS
