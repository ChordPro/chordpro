# The Song Editor

The Song Editor can be used to create new ChordPro song files, and
maintain existing ones.

Select `Create a new song` the main screen and the editor will open.

![]({{< asset "images/chordpro-gui-editor-p1.png" >}})

Move the cursor to the line 2, and insert a subtitle directive
using the `Insert` menu.

![]({{< asset "images/chordpro-gui-editor-p2.png" >}})

Type `My First`.

![]({{< asset "images/chordpro-gui-editor-p3.png" >}})

Press the Enter key and notice that the closing brace of the
directice stays at the right place.

Add a song line: Type `[` followed by a lowercase `a`. Now type the
closing `]`. You will see that the chord name is automatically
upcased, and the chord is shown in colour. Add a bit more for fun.

![]({{< asset "images/chordpro-gui-editor-p4.png" >}})

Now it's time for results. Press the `Preview` button.

![]({{< asset "images/chordpro-gui-editor-p5.png" >}})

As you can see the preview has a number of controls that allow you to
make it larger or smaller, and to page through if there are multiple
pages.

You can change the appearance of the
song in the [settings]({{< relref "chordpro-gui-settings/#presets"
>}}).

In the unlikely event that you made some typing errors, helpful
information is given in the form of in-source *diagnostic flags*.

![]({{< asset "images/chordpro-gui-editor-p6.png" >}})

Click on one of the `Messages` buttons to view additional diagnostics.

![]({{< asset "images/chordpro-gui-editor-p7.png" >}})

The diagnostic flags will automatically be cleared when you generate a new
preview. You can also clear them manually from the `Edit` menu.

When you stop ChordPro, or switch to another file, you are prompted to
save the song first. If a preview was generated you are offered to
save this too.

Next: [Tasks]({{< relref "chordpro-gui-tasks" >}}).
