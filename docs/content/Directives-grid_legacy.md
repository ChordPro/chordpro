## grid

Abbreviation: `g`.

Enables printing of the list of chord diagrams at the end of the current song.

For persistent use, this can better be set in the [[configuration files|ChordPro Configuration]]. However, it is already set by default. The only use for the `grid` directive is to enable printing chord diagrams for the current song when printing the diagrams has been disabled globally.

The name `grid` is an unfortunate legacy from the original chord program and must not be confused with the [[chord grids|Directives env_grid]] facility.

## no_grid

Abbreviation: `ng`.

Disables printing of the list of chord diagrams at the end of the current song.

For persistent use, this can better be set in the [[configuration files|ChordPro Configuration]]. The only use for the `no_grid` directive is to disable printing chord diagrams for the current song when printing the diagrams has been enabled globally.
