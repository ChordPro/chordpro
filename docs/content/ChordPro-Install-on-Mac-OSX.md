# Installation on Mac OS/X


Modern versions of Mac OS/X come with a pre-installed version of Perl that is capable of running the command line version of ChordPro. Just open a command terminal window and type

`sudo cpan chordpro`

Make sure you are running the system version of the `cpan` tool. If in doubt, type this instead:

`sudo /usr/bin/cpan chordpro`

Your individual configuration file can be placed at

`/Users/USER/.config/chordpro/chordpro.json`
