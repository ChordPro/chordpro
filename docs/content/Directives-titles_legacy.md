# Directives: titles

**Deprecated.** Use the [configuration files]({{< relref "ChordPro-Configuration" >}}) instead.

`{titles:` _flush_ `}`

If _flush_ is `left`, song titles are printed to the left of the page.  
If _flush_ is `right`, song titles are printed to the right of the page.  
If _flush_ is `center`, titles are printed centered on top of the page. This is the default if this directive is not used.

Example:

    {titles: center}
