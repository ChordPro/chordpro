# Defining an instrument

ChordPro deals with chords. To do so, it needs to know hiow chords are
named, how they are ordered, and how they are played.

## How are chords named

The usual convention for chord names consists of three parts: the
_root_, the _quality_, and the _extension_.

For example, in the chord `Dm7`, the root is `D`, the quality is
`m` (minor), and the extension is `7`. A chord always has a root, the
quality and/or the extension may be omitted if it is not needed. `C`
names a C major chord, `D7` a D dominant 7 chord, and `Em` a E minor
chord.

### Root

The most widely spread convention for root names is the use of _Dutch_
or _common_ note names: the letters `C`, `D`, `E`, `F`, `G`, `A`, and `B`. 

## How are the chords ordered.

To transpose chords, it must know the order of the chords

## How are chords played.

To produce chord diagrams, ChordPro must know the number of strings of
the instrument, how they are tuned, and where the fingers must be
placed when playing the chord.
