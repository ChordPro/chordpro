# I’ve added `{sortartist...}` or `{tag...}` but I get _Unknown directive_

This is most likely a problem with your configuration.

The list of valid metadata directives is defined in the ChordPro
configuration file. Recently some directives were added to that list,
including `sortartist` and `tag`.

If you have ever copied the ChordPro configuration file to
create your own, chances are that the metadata definitions are also there.
Basicsally, your list of metadata directives —which does not have the
new items— overwrites ChordPro's updated list. As a result, when you
run ChordPro, it will not know the new added items.

For this reason is it is always best to remove **everything you do not
need** from a copied configuration file. Better still, use the
template configuration as generated by the ChordPro 
[CLI]({{< relref "chordpro-configuration-create-cli/#important" >}}) and
[GUI]({{< relref "chordpro-configuration-create-gui/#important" >}}).
