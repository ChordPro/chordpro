    - !Highlights

    - Images can be [placed everywhere](https://chordpro.org/chordpro/directives-image/).
      They can be placed relative to the paper, the page, the column,
      and the lyrics.

    - Images can be [embedded](https://chordpro.org/chordpro/directives-image/#inline-images) in text (lyrics) lines, either as part of
      the text similar to a glyph, or somewhere else on the page
      relative to a particular place in the text. The latter is most
      interesting for annotations.

    - Delegates are images too. Annotate your lyrics with SVG images
      and musical notes using ABC or Lilypond.

    - Chord and keyboard diagrams are images too. And you can use
      string and keyboard diagrams simultaneously.

    - Resources like configs, tasks and images are now more logically
      searched using [resource
      libraries](https://chordpro.org/chordpro/resources/).

    - !Highlights

    - [ABC](https://www.chordpro.org/chordpro/directives-env_abc/)
      and [Lilypond](https://www.chordpro.org/chordpro/directives-env_ly/)
      embedding now use SVG (vector graphics) instead of pixmap images.
      This is very crisp at all sizes, and
      greatly reduces the size of the resultant PDF document.
      + No additional tools are required for embedding, except the
      `abc2svg` and `lilypond` tools. The installer kits for MS
      Windows and MacOS already include the `abc2svg` tool.

    - The ChordPro GUI (`wxchordpro`) has been extended with a Tasks
      menu that can be used to quickly select presets for a specific
      task. For example, to produce a PDF with only lyrics, or with
      keyboard diagrams instead of string diagrams. User presets can
      be added by placing small config files in a `tasks` folder under
      the `CHORDPRO_LIB`.

    - !ChordPro functionality
    - Directives and config to change the [chorus appearance](https://www.chordpro.org/chordpro/directives-props_chorus_legacy/).

    - Add 'omit' to delegates config.
    - Infer chord inversions for keyboard.
    - Use SVGPDF text callback to substitute missing flat/sharp glyphs.
