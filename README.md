## Development Status
This program provides support for ChordPro version 6.
It supports almost all features of Chordii, and a lot more,
like native PDF generation, Unicode input and fully customizable layout, fonts and sizes.

Prominent features of ChordPro 6 are Pango style text markup, annotations,
and a more powerful way of assigning typefaces to layout items.

For up-to-date information, see <https://www.chordpro.org/chordpro/chordpro-reference-implementation>

## Motivation
ChordPro is a rewrite of Chordii.
Why a rewrite?
Chordii was the de facto reference implementation of the ChordPro file format standard version 4.

ChordPro version 5 added a number of new features, pushing the limits of the very old program.
Unicode support would have been very hard to add, and the whole program centered around PostScript generation, while nowadays PDF would be a much better alternative.

So, we decided to create a new reference implementation from the ground up.
We chose a programming language that is flexible and very good at handling Unicode data.
And that is fun to program in.
