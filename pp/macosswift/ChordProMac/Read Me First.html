    <h1>Important notes for running ChordPro on macOS</h1>

    <p>This is an unsigned application for macOS 12 and later.</p>

    <p style="color:red;font-weight:bold">YOU CANNOT JUST OPEN THE APPLICATION</p>

    <p>Due to security reasons, an <em>unsigned</em> application cannot just be opened.</p>
    <p>Signing you application, even for distribution outside an Apple Store requires a yearly paid supscription.</p>

    <p>This is not unfair, however, there are no members in the <strong>ChordPro</strong> community able to provide a signed binary at the moment.</p>

    <p>For more information, see this <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-gb/guide/mac-help/mh40616/mac">Apple</a> document.</p>

    <h2>How to open the application</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>`Right-click` the application and choose ‘open’</li>
        <li>You will get a warning that the application is not verified and you are suggested to move int to the bin. Press `cancel`.</li>
        <li>`Right-click` again and choose ‘open’ again.</li>
        <li>Now you can choose ‘open anyway’ and the application should start.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Next time you can just open it without any warnings.</p>

    <p>Even though the build is `Intel` only it will still run on arm-macs as well.</p>

    <p>The reason it is not an universal binary is that an unsigned arm-version will simply refuse to open...</p>
