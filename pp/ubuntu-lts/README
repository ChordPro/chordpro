These are adapted files to build a statically linked appimage on an
as-old-as-possible-but-still-supported Ubuntu LTS system.
Currently, this means 22.04.

See https://discourse.appimage.org/t/specify-required-glibc-version-in-appimage/2413/5.

We'll use an official wxWidgets build, kindly provided by the CodeLite team.
