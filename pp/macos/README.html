            <h1>ChordPro for macOS</h1>

            <h2>What is ChordPro</h2>

            <p><strong>ChordPro</strong>, the application, is first and foremost a graphical application and the reference implementation for the <strong>ChordPro</strong> standard:</p>

            <blockquote>
                <p>“A simple text format for the notation of lyrics with chords”.</p>
            </blockquote>

            <p>It has a very pleasant and easy to use interface that gives you the basics of using <strong>ChordPro</strong>; both the <em>application</em> as well its <em>text-format</em>.</p>

            <h3>Advanced usage</h3>

            <p>The package you downloaded also contains a very powerful but maybe <em>hard-to-use</em> application that you have to run in the <code>Teminal</code>.</p>

            <p>Expert users can use this <code>Teminal</code> version for even more complex operations.</p>

            <h2>It is not just drag and drop</h2>

            <p>Providing applications for the Mac platform is not as easy as it seems. For the users, its mostly just <em>drag and drop</em>. It is not that easy for developers. Apple has a <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-gb/guide/security/secf826eff27/web">lot of security</a> in place to make sure your <em>drag and drop</em> will be safe for you.</p>

            <p>It needs a lot of time, effort and yeh... money for developers to provide such application for the Mac.</p>

            <p><strong>ChordPro</strong> is not a commercial product. It is an <em>Open Source</em> application made by volunteers. You are welcome to <a href="https://github.com/ChordPro/chordpro">download the source</a>, compile it and enjoy!</p>

            <p>That is not realistic for must users, especially not on the Mac. We would love to provide you the expected experience but we can’t. There is nobody in the <strong>ChordPro</strong> community with an Apple Developers certificate to provide you this <em>ready to go</em> experience.</p>

            <h2>The Gatekeeper</h2>

            <p>Your download contains an <em>almost</em> ready to go <strong>ChordPro</strong>; except that the application is only ad-hoc signed by us and not by an approved Apple Developer with a valid certificate. So, the security system on your Mac will give an error when you double-click the application. You have met the <em>Gatekeeper</em>. Depending of the version of macOS you have a different message and have to do different additional handlings to open <strong>ChordPro</strong>.</p>

            <ol>
                <li>Drag the application to your <code>Applications</code> folder.
                <li>Open the application by <em>double-clicking</em> on it.
            </ol>

            <p>A prompt saying '“<strong>ChordPro</strong>“ Not Opened' will appear.</p>

            <p>The message will be more or less like this, depending on your macOS version:</p>

            <blockquote>
                <p>Apple could not verify “ChordPro.app“ is free of malware that may harm your Mac or compromise your privacy.</p>
            </blockquote>

            <p><em>There is a small 'question mark' button at the right top of the dialog that opens the 'Mac User Guide' with more information.</em></p>

            <p>On macOS versions before 15 (Sequoia) it was common practice to <code>right-click</code> the application and choose <code>Open</code> from the menu. That trick will bypass the gatekeeper and let you open the application.</p>

            <p>Unfortunately, that does not work anymore on Sequoia and you have to go trough <code>System Settings</code>:</p>

            <ol start="3">
                <li>Go to <code>System Settings -&gt; Privacy &amp; Security</code>.</li>
                <li>Scroll down to find <strong>ChordPro</strong>, and an option to &quot;Open Anyway&quot;.</li>
                <li>Choose &quot;Open Anyway&quot;.</li>
                <li>Authenticate as an administrator.</li>
                <li><strong>ChordPro</strong> will now open.</li>
            </ol>

            <p><strong>ChordPro</strong> is saved as an exception to your security settings and you can open it in the future by double-clicking it, just as you can with any other application.</p>

            <h2>The Terminal Application</h2>

            <p>The <code>Terminal</code> application, simply called <code>chordpro</code> is part of the package.</p>
            
            <blockquote><strong>To use the <code>Terminal</code> application you first have give the GUI application permission to run on your system. Do that first.</strong></blockquote>

            <h3>Temporarily add it to your system path</h3>
            
            <p>To <em>temporarily</em> add the <strong>chordpro</strong> command line application to the system path issue the following command in the <code>Terminal</code> window:</p>

            <div class="terminal">
                <code>export PATH="/Applications/ChordPro.app/Contents/Resources/cli":$PATH
                </code>
            </div>
            
            <p>Now you can use the <strong>chordpro</strong> command line application in the <em>Terminal</em> without its full path, however, when you close the <em>Terminal</em> you have add the path again the next time. It is recommended to add it permanently; see below.

            <h3>Permanently add it to your system path</h3>
            
            <p>To add the command line application <em>permanently</em> to your system path there is no simple command for the <em>Terminal</em>. However, it is not difficult.</p>
            
            <p>First, create a file pointing to your <strong>chordpro</strong> CLI directory in the <code>Terminal</code>:

            <div class="terminal">
                <code>echo "/Applications/ChordPro.app/Contents/Resources/cli" > ~/Desktop/chordpro
                </code>
            </div>
            
            <p>This will create a file with the location of the <strong>chordpro</strong> CLI command on your Desktop. You have to move this file with the <code>Finder</code> so the <code>Terminal</code> will see it:</p>
            
            <ol>
                <li>In the <code>Finder</code>, go to its menu at the top and 'Go -> Go to Folder...'</li>
                <li>In the dialog, enter `/etc/paths.d`. It should <em>auto-complete</em> and if you press the `Enter` key it will open a new Finder window.</li>
                <li>Now Drag & Drop' the 'chordpro' file you just created on your Desktop to this folder. It will ask for your <em>administration password</em>.</li>
                <li>Open a new <code>Terminal</code> window and check if it is all ok:</li>
            </ol>

            <div class="terminal">
                <code>chordpro --about
                </code>
            </div>
            
            <p><em>This should show you information about <strong>chordpro</strong> if all went well</em>.</p>
            
            <h2>Enjoy!</h2>

            <p>We hope you appreciate our best efforts to bring <strong>ChordPro</strong> to macOS.</p>

            <p>The Mac is a beautiful platform for its users. However, not so much for its Mac developers nowadays. We do our best.</p>

            <p><strong>Are you a macOS developer with an Developer Account? Please help us to provide a signed package to improve the user experience.</strong></p>
