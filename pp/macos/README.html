<h1>Important notes for running ChordPro on MacOS</h1>

<p>Due to MacOS security constraints it is currently not possible to use
  the standard file open and save dialogs. As a consequence, you will
  not be able to open arbitrary (ChordPro) files, and save changes into
  arbitrary files.</p>

<p>The advised way of using ChordPro is by double-clicking a ChordPro
  document in the Finder. Alternatively you can use drag and drop, or
  the Finder <code>Open with ...</code> command.</p>

<p>ChordPro is currently limited to one document at a time.</p>

<p>When ChordPro is started with a document, you can make changes
  and save your changes into the document.</p>

<p>When ChordPro is started without document, it presents a
  dummy document containing just a title. You can edit and preview
  but you will not be able to save your changes.</p>
<p>Hint: You can use Select All (command-A) and copy and paste
  to transfer the contents to somewhere else.</p>

<p>Due to MacOS security constraints it is currently not possible
  to select a custon config file, library or template using a file
  chooser. Instead, you must type the name of an existing file or
  folder in the Preferences dialog.</p>

<p>Printing from the Finder is like opening.</p>

<p>ChordPro on MacOS currently does not support embedding of ABC and LilyPond.</p>

<h2>Hints</h2>

<p>The ChordPro 'app' has two binaries: the ChordPro GUI program (default)
  and the command line version. Provided the dmg is mounted in its default
  location, you can run the command line version from a Terminal window with:</p>

<code>/Volumes/ChordPro\ Installer/ChordPro.app/Contents/MacOS/chordpro</code>
