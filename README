NAME

    App::Music::ChordPro - A lyrics and chords formatting program

DESCRIPTION

    ChordPro will read a text file containing the lyrics of one or many songs
    plus chord information. ChordPro will then generate a photo-ready,
    professional looking, impress-your-friends sheet-music suitable for
    printing on your nearest printer.

    To learn more about ChordPro, look for the man page or do "chordpro
    --help" for the list of options.

    ChordPro is a rewrite of the Chordii program, see
    <http://www.chordii.org>.

MOTIVATION

    Why a rewrite of Chordii?

    Chordii is the de facto reference implementation of the ChordPro file
    format standard. It implements ChordPro version 4.

    ChordPro version 5 adds a number of new features, and this was pushing the
    limits of the very old program. Unicode support would have been very hard
    to add, and the whole program centered around PostScript generation, while
    nowadays PDF would be a much better alternative.

    So I decided to create a new reference implementation from the ground up.
    I chose a programming language that is flexible and very good at handling
    Unicode data. And that is fun to program in.

CURRENT STATUS

    This program provides support for ChordPro version 5. It supports
    most of the features of Chordii, and a lot more:

    * Native PDF generation.

    * Unicode support (all input is UTF8).

    * User defined chords and tunings, not limited to 6 strings.

    * Support for external TrueType and OpenType fonts.

    * Font kerning (with external fonts).

    * Fully customizable layout, fonts and sizes.

    * A basic but effective GUI version (optional).

    * Customizable backends for PDF, ChordPro, LilyPond*, LaTeX* and HTML*.
      (* = under development)

INSTALLATION

    To run ChordPro, you need Perl, a programming environment that is
    available for most systems and probably already installed on yours.

    Step one: Open a command prompt and type

      perl --version

    If you get a message similar to this

      This is perl 5, version 24, ...

    You have Perl installed and you can proceed with step two.

    If not, you can get Perl from

      www.strawberryperl.org
      www.ActiveState.com

    Step two for Linux and Strawberry Perl: at the command prompt,
    type

      cpan App::cpanm
      cpanm wxchordpro

    This will pull in ChordPro from the CPAN archives and install it
    for you.

    Step two for ActiveState Perl: at the command prompt, type

      ppm App-Music-ChordPro-Wx

    Step three: At the command prompt, type

      wxchordpro

    You can add a desktop icon for easy access.

    Alternatively, you can clone the GitHub repository and run the
    programs in the scripts directory. You may have to manually add
    dependencies with "cpan" or "ppm", just as described above.
