NAME

    App::Music::ChordPro - A lyrics and chords formatting program

DESCRIPTION

    ChordPro will read a text file containing the lyrics of one or many songs
    plus chord information. ChordPro will then generate a photo-ready,
    professional looking, impress-your-friends sheet-music suitable for
    printing on your nearest printer.

    To learn more about ChordPro, look for the man page or do "chordpro
    --help" for the list of options.

    ChordPro is a rewrite of the Chordii program, see
    <http://www.chordii.org>.

MOTIVATION

    Why a rewrite of Chordii?

    Chordii is the de facto reference implementation of the ChordPro file
    format standard. It implements ChordPro version 4.

    ChordPro version 5 adds a number of new features, and this was pushing the
    limits of the very old program. Unicode support would have been very hard
    to add, and the whole program centered around PostScript generation, while
    nowadays PDF would be a much better alternative.

    So I decided to create a new reference implementation from the ground up.
    I chose a programming language that is flexible and very good at handling
    Unicode data. And that is fun to program in.

CURRENT STATUS

    This program provides support for ChordPro version 5. It supports
    almost all of the features of Chordii, and a lot more, like native
    PDF generation, Unicode input and fully customizable layout, fonts
    and sizes.
